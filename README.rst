Introduction
============

`django-minify` is a package that combines and minifies your css and
javascript files. If you are using the `Jinja 2` template system than it is
also possible to compile all these templates and pregenerate all minified
javascript/css files.

Install
=======

To install simply execute `python setup.py install`.
If you want to run the tests first, run `python setup.py nosetests`

Or run something like `pip install django-minify` when using `pip`.
